<section>
	Dr. Lingpeng Kong is looking for several PhD students (starting Fall 2021) with interests in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Students will be fully funded.
	<br><br>

	Dr. Kong is a tenure-track assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a>, adjunct in the <a href="https://saasweb.hku.hk/">Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science</a>, at the <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">University of Hong Kong</a> (HKU). His research tackles the core problems in natural language processing (NLP) by designing representation learning algorithms that exploit linguistic structures. His work lies at the intersection of deep learning and structured prediction, with an application focus on syntactic parsing, speech recognition, social media analysis and machine translation.
	<br><br>

	Before joining HKU, he was a senior research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com/">Google DeepMind</a>. Dr. Kong obtained his Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> co-advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nasmith/">Noah Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer">Chris Dyer</a>.
	<br><br>

	If you are passionate about research, self-motivated, have a strong background in computer science, mathematics or statistics, and are interested in working with Dr. Kong, please apply to the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/programmes/research-based/admission-2021">HKU PhD program</a> and mention Dr. Kong in your statement. Please also send an email to <a href="mailto:lpk@cs.hku.hk">lpk@cs.hku.hk</a> with your resume.
