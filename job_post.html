<section>
	Dr. Lingpeng Kong is looking for PhD students with interests in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Students will be fully funded.
	<br><br>

	Dr. Kong is a tenure-track assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a> , the <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">University of Hong Kong</a> (HKU). His research tackles the core problems in natural language processing (NLP) by designing representation learning algorithms that exploit linguistic structures. His work lies at the intersection of deep learning and structured prediction, with an application focus on syntactic parsing, speech recognition, social media analysis and machine translation.
	<br><br>

	Before joining HKU, he was a senior research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com/">Google DeepMind</a>. Dr. Kong obtained his Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> co-advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nasmith/">Noah Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer">Chris Dyer</a>.
	<br><br>

	The current focus of our group includes:<br><br>
	(1)	Pretraining algorithms, including novel objectives, neural network architectures and distillation methods.<br>
	(2)	Text generation and its automatic evaluation. <br>
	(3)	Machine Translation, especially in the settings of simultaneous and multimodal MT.
	<br><br>


	If you are passionate about research, self-motivated, have a strong background in computer science, mathematics or statistics, and are interested in working with Dr. Kong, please apply to the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/programmes/research-based/admission-2021">HKU PhD program</a> and mention Dr. Kong in your statement. Please also fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQVtUQgofMOksSWUjyIj5Vamh-n_IWB8fk2qeG8fa4V9JrRw/viewform?usp=sf_link">form</a>.
