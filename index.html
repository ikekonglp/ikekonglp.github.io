<!-- Lingpeng Kong is an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">University of Hong Kong</a> (HKU). His research interest is to design the next generation of neural architectures and develop corresponding pre-trained sequence models and algorithms, especially by harnessing the ability to process ultra-long sequences, ultimately for advancing scientific discovery. Before joining HKU, he was a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a>. He obtained his Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">University of Hong Kong</a> (HKU), and a co-director of the <a href="https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/">HKU NLP Lab</a>. My work lies at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), with a focus on representation learning, structured prediction, and generative models. Before joining HKU, I was a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> (<a href="https://www.kingscross.co.uk/pancras-square">London</a>). I obtained my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. For more details, see my <a href="lingpenk_cv.pdf">academic c.v.</a>

<h2> Research</h2><br>
<strong>Neural architecture design.</strong> We were dedicated to designing general-purpose sequence neural network architectures and corresponding model encoding and decoding algorithms. We designed a series of novel, efficient, and general sequence model architectures, including the random feature attention family (RFA, LARA, EVA), enabling ultra-long sequence processsing in transformer architectures.<br><br>
<strong>Large language models and algorithms.</strong><br><br>
<strong>Computational science.</strong> Our team employs state-of-the-art AI algorithms to explore various scientific domains. In protein sequence modeling, we propose an effective retrieval-based method (RSA) as a replacement to AlphaFold's multiple sequence alignments for inputting evolutionary knowledge. In mathematics and theorem proving, we use large language models to guide problem decomposition (STP, SEGO), reducing the vast search space. In chemistry and pharmaceuticals, we predict molecular properties by integrating graph information and textual knowledge into a language model, with our zero-shot approach (GIMLET) achieving results comparable to supervised GNN models in predicting toxicity and bioactivity.

In my hour of need, I chose Erasmus of Rotterdam to help me -- a man of the centre and a man of reason who was also caught between the millstones of Protestantism and Catholicism, just as we are caught between the great opposing movements of our day. I found consolation in realising ... that one is not alone, when one is troubled out of a sense of decency by having to make difficult decisions and resolutions, instead of just taking the easy way out by jumping onto the back of some party.
